                        <strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF COOPERATION WITH INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        These Terms and Conditions of Cooperation with Independent Contractors, Subcontractors, Employees and Management (the &quot;Cooperation Terms&quot;) regulate the cooperation of the Company (as defined in the Agreement) with persons entering into the Agreement for the Supply of Services (the &quot;Agreement&quot;), and constitute an integral part of the Agreement. The Agreement constitutes a summary of Contractor&#39;s obligations under these Cooperation Terms, and the list and scope of such obligations as stipulated in the Agreement is non-exhaustive; in case of any discrepancies between the Agreement and the Cooperation Terms, the terms and conditions of the Cooperation Terms shall prevail.</p>
                    <p>
                        All persons entering into the Agreement with the Company (the &quot;Subcontractors&quot;) confirm that they:</p>
                    <p>
                        -&nbsp;have familiarized themselves with the provisions of the Cooperation Terms and fully understand them;</p>

                    <p>
                        -&nbsp;are cognizant of the fact that any violation of the Cooperation Terms is capable of causing termination of the cooperation with the Company and/or imposing responsibility upon the Subcontractor under applicable legislation.</p>
                    <p>
                        Subcontractor&#39;s consent to enter into the Agreement means his/her consent to all provisions of these Cooperation Terms (that constitute an integral part of the Agreement), and is a precondition of Subcontractor&#39;s cooperation with the Company in any capacity; the Subcontractor enters into the Agreement and agrees with the Cooperation Terms in consideration for the Engagement (as this term is defined in these Cooperation Terms).</p>
                    <p>
                        Any reference to the &quot;Parties&quot; in these Cooperation Terms shall apply to persons entering into the Agreement that refers to these Cooperation Terms (i.e. the Company and the Subcontractor).</p>
                    <p>
                        The Company reserves the right to amend the provisions of the Cooperation Terms unilaterally (to the extent relevant to the subject matter of the Agreement and the Cooperation Terms). The Company may, at its sole discretion (but is not obliged to), notify the Subcontractor of the amendments of the Cooperation Terms. Any amendments of the Cooperation Terms are legally binding for the Subcontractor; in case the Subcontractor objects to any amendments of the Cooperation Terms, he/she shall immediately terminate the Engagement and perform all relevant actions as may be required in connection with the termination of the Engagement.</p>
                    <p>

                        (a)&nbsp;the minimum amount of such remuneration required by any mandatory rules of applicable law (if any);</p>

Субпідрядник підтверджує, що така винагорода за Відповідні Права ІВ є достатньою, і жодна інша винагорода за Відповідні Права ІВ або Відповідні Об&#39;єкти ІВ не підлягає сплаті Субпідряднику. У максимальній мірі, дозволеній відповідно до застосовного права, Субпідрядник відмовляється від права, яке він може мати, на оскарження передачі Відповідних Прав ІВ Компанії або дійсності будь-якого положення Угоди та/або Умов співпраці на підставі нездійснення Компанією оплати такої винагороди.</p>
